# simple-weather
This is a very simple concept weather page built using Vue.js and retrieving data from the open weather API.

Axios is also used for the retrieval of the API data, which is received as a JSON file.

The site lets a user search for a city/town (out of a set number of added cities and towns) and displays a 5 day weather forecast for that place. The website is hosted using Netlify and can be viewed [here](www.robertsweather.xyz).
